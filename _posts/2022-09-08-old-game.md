The most challenging part of implementing Pac Man was getting the ghost AIs to work.
* There are boxes on screen indicating which node the ghosts are targeting.
* Red Ghost Blinky chases the previous path node Pac Man was at.
* Pink Ghost Pinky chases the point 80 units in front of Pac Man.
* Blue Ghost Inky chases according to Blinky's position and Pac-Man's position
* Yellow Ghost Clyde chases like Blink if Pac Man is further than 150 units away; otherwise scatter to origin
* Ghosts find their path using greedy method, so the paths they take are not the shortest path.
